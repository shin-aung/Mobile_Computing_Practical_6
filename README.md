**Learning Journey: Creating Foley App with Android UI Design Patterns and SoundPool API**

In a dedicated session of approximately 3 hours, I worked on developing a Foley App, integrating Android UI design patterns and utilizing the SoundPool API. The following is a breakdown of my tasks and experiences.

**Task 1 - Collect Audio Samples and Decide on Categories (20 mins):**

Created a new project "FoleyApp" with a minimum SDK level of 21. Downloaded audio samples for four categories: nature, animals, human, and technology. Renamed files to adhere to Android resource naming conventions and organized them into the "raw" folder.

**Task 2 - Setup the Project (40 mins):**

Configured the main activity with buttons for each sound category using LinearLayout.
Explored Material Design 3 by updating dependencies and adjusting the theme.
Customized colors using a palette from coolors.
Added a secondary activity "FoleyActivity" with an ImageView for displaying sound category-related images.
Implemented button handlers to send category information to FoleyActivity using explicit intents.

**Task 3 - Use the SoundPool API:**

Refactored and incorporated an extended version of AudioManager, a SoundPool Fa√ßade, to handle loading and organizing sounds by category.

**Task 4 - Explore Basic Touch Events:**

Implemented basic touch event handling in FoleyActivity to capture user touch positions on the image view. Explored the possibility of triggering sound samples based on touch locations.

**Task 5 - Self-Reflection (30 mins):**

**Description of the Experience:**

Engaging in this exercise allowed me to delve into Android UI design patterns and the SoundPool API, enhancing my understanding of creating interactive and visually appealing apps.

**Feelings and Thoughts about the Experience:**

The initial setup was straightforward, and exploring Material Design 3 provided insights into UI modernization. Integrating touch events and sound handling added a dynamic aspect to the app.

**Evaluation of the Experience, Both Good and Bad:**

Positive aspects included successful integration of UI elements and functionalities. Challenges were encountered in handling touch events for specific sound triggers.

**Analysis to Make Sense of the Situation:**

The use of Material Design and SoundPool API demonstrated their impact on user experience. Analyzing touch events highlighted the need for precise control over triggering actions.

**Conclusion about What I Learned and What I Could Have Done Differently:**

Learned the importance of balancing visual appeal with functional aspects. In retrospect, exploring alternative strategies for handling touch events might offer more efficient solutions.

**Action Plan for Future Situations or Changes:**

Future focus will involve mastering alternative strategies for touch event handling and deeper exploration of advanced Android features.
